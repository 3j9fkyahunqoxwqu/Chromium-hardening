The RLZ string is an encoded string that contains no indentifying information. It’s used purely to gauge how well promotional campaigns did ie: if an ad runs on Monday they want to know how many people downloaded it Tuesday. That’s the kind of information in the RLZ String and the source code is provided to decode the RLZ and look inside.

It couldn’t really be less malicious unless you have a problem with Google knowing that someone out in the wide world downloaded their browser on a Tuesday.

You can disable this on Linux by default. Under Windows it's a different story but it also doesn’t even exist in typical builds downloaded from Google’s website, **only for builds having to do with marketing campaigns**. Firefox has same build with such things integrated they call it 'studies'.

The RLZ String doesn’t actually exist in Chromium.
