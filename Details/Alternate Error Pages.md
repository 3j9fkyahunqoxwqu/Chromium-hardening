When Chrome hits a page that canâ€™t be reached it replaces the error message.

A few facts:

* Navigation errors are first checked locally.
* Only a hash is sent to Google, this can't be used for marketing or tracking.
* All GET parameters are removed.
* It can be easily disabled. 
* You can disable it via about:config or enable a pre-cached history of the site.
