## Suggestions

Suggest is referring to the Omnibox suggestions. In order to predict what you’re searching for Chrome sends the text in the URL bar to the default search engine. Chrome itself has no default search engine, you choose on during the installation. You are then subject to that search engines privacy restrictions, I use StartPage so it’s really them logging me.

This is entirely configurable. You can disable it with absolute ease. All the Iron browser has done is disable the option by default and removed the ability to enable it. To disable it check the Chrome Privacy Settings.
